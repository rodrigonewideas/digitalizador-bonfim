## Important

This package provides LEGACY Python Database API 2.0-compliant driver for the open
source relational database **Firebird version 2.5.**, with **limited support for Firebird 3.0**.
It does NOT support Firebird 4 and newer.

If you are using Firebird 3 or newer, please use the OFFICIAL Python driver for Firebird
called [firebird-driver](https://pypi.org/project/firebird-driver/).

The FDB driver is not actively developed and its maintenance is very limited.
